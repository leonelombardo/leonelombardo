# üëã | Hey there, Leonel over here. 

I'm a **front-end developer** from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I love **developing solutions**. I've always believed in technology as a way of **making things work in a better way**, and that's one of the reasons I'm into it.

Beyond web developing, **I love to learn**. I'm constantly learning even when it's not about technology, **it's not a problem for me to dive into other areas**, in the end, I'd dare to say that **not exercising our brain is a way to letting it die slowly**.

## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª | Technologies

These are all the technologies **I'm ready to develop in**, them are not as many as I'd like but in the meantime **I'm still learning** more.

I've developed/worked with them on **more than one occasion** so I'm **quite comfy** developing/working with them.

## üé® | Design

I've knowledge about **graphic design** because I've worked for five years as a **graphic designer**.

Even though I'm fully into **web solutions/development** I'm still designing but not that much.
